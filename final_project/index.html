    <h3>U.S. Food Imports and U.S. Immigration</h3>
    <p>Americans are ethnically diverse and it affects the food choices that people make which shifts 
      altogether with migration change. Historically, the U.S. has been considered one of the easiest 
      countries to immigrate to, and according to the UN Department of Economics and Social Affairs, 
      as of mid-2020 the United States has the highest immigrant population in the world at 50.6 million. 
      The reasons for immigration can vary and depend on many factors such as seeking improved career 
      opportunities, reuniting with family, better access to  healthcare or education, escape from 
      military conflicts, etc. The data from the U.S. Department of Agriculture shows that the imports 
      of edible products have changed in the last thirty years and the set of foods nowadays includes 
      more tropical products, spices, and imported gourmet products than before. Also, the USA imports 
      some products throughout the whole year, such as cocoa and coffee. Some imported products go to 
      agricultural-processing industries based in the United States for further export to third countries. 
      I wanted to see if the trade had any correlation with immigration between 2017 and 2020. 
      In order to do that, I will select the 6 countries with the highest import values and 
      the 6 countries with the highest number of immigrants during that time period and visualize 
      these relationships.

    <p>There are two countries, the Philippines and Mexico, whose  high food import value correlates with the high  number of 
      immigrants. Three countries France, Italy and Singapore which have a low food import value correlates with low numbers of 
      immigrants. Canada has one of the highest food import values but a low number of immigrants; and China, India and 
      the Dominican Republic have a low food import value but high numbers of immigrants. This tendency almost hasn't changed between 
      2017 and 2020. However there is a significant drop in the number of immigrants in 2020 from all countries due to the pandemic, 
      while the food import value from all the countries almost hasn't changed since 2019.
